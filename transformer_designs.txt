Transformer Designs:


Design-A: N_turn_primary=5



Hi Mark,

Sorry, it takes longer than I anticipated as I have to design the transformer from scratch.
Here are some results. I obtained the transformer parameters from the Matlab model:

Primary coil: (Foil type)
Coil thickness: 3.15 mm
Coil height: 172 mm
Number of turns: 8
Mean length per turn: 1377 mm
AC resistance: 0.011 Ohm

Secondary coil: (Circular)
Coil area (6mm^2), diameter: 2.764 mm
Total winding height: 192 mm
Nturns: 800 (vertical:20, horizontal:40 layers)
Total winding width: 318 mm
Mean length per turn: 2361 mm

Core:
Cross-section: 278 x 278 mm
Horizontal gap: 572 mm
Vertical gap: 192 mm
Core height: 748 mm
Core width: 1128 mm
Volume: 0.21 m^3
Mass: ~1500 kg

Core Material:
Nano-crystalline (Vitroperm 500)
B_saturation: 1.2 T
B-H curve: attached

Core losses:
From the manuals I was only able to find the core losses between 20 kHz and 100 kHz. I have extrapolated the loss data for 1-20 kHz using this data and datasheets of similar materials.
The loss data (flux density vs loss density (W/kg) vs frequency) presented in the data-sheet are linear in log-x and log-y axes. The core losses increases with the square of the flux density magnitude.

I have attached a spreadsheet presenting the losses between 1 kHz and 20 kHz for various operating flux densities, which can be used in the optimization algorithm.
For information at 1 T loss density varies as follows:
1 kHz    0.25 W/kg
5 kHz    4.8 W/kg
10 kHz    17.5 W/kg
15 kHz    37.1 W/kg
20 kHz    63.3 W/kg

Assuming a 1500 kg core and 1.2 T operating flux density, total core losses is around 600 W. Increasing the operating frequency will reduce the mass of the core, but increase the core loss density.

I hope it helps for now.

Regards,

Ozan
