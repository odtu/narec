# Assumptions from WP2 Document

## Core Material

It is stated that amorphous material and the nano-crystalline material are the most suitable for  high frequency transformers. 

nano-crystalline is better, but operation temperature is limited (120 C), and it is more expensive.


## Winding

Low voltage side: Foil topology (reduces the size and weight).
High voltage side: Circular strands (mechanical strength and increased dielectric strength).

## Insulation 

Dry transformer is chosen for increased reliability. Epoxy material is used for insulation.

Water cooling system to reduce the size.
