significant parasitic (leakage) inductance occurs due to HV insulation requirements between primary and secondary winding

!!AREA PRODUCT
The area product AP is the product of the winding window area and the cross-sectional area of the core, and it is a useful design parameter in selecting the core and the number of turns per volt [15].

AP = Pt ×10^4/ 4 Bm f Ku J (3)

where AP is the area product (cm4), Pt is the apparent power handling capability (VA), Bm is the maximum core flux density (T), f is the operating frequency (Hz), Ku is the window utilisation factor and J is the wire current density (A/cm2).


30 kW, 60 kW, 20 kHz transformer

isolation -> transformer oil 160 kV/cm, but dielectric constant is small 2-2.25. So the parasitic capacitance can be reduced.


Transformer oil is a good medium for heat transport. Under ideal natural convection conditions it has heat transfer coefficient of ?95W/m2 K1; this is equivalent to forced ideal natural convection conditions it has heat transfer coefficient of ?95W/m2; this is equivalent to forced air-cooling with a flow velocity of ?25 m/s [2].

table-II material properties

Usually, a 10% to 20% safety margin is introduced by transformer designers between ˆ
B and Bsat to avoid operation close to saturation due to possible small asymmetries in the applied voltage or transients.


In transformers with concentric windings, a good analytical estimation of the leakage inductance Lσ can be achieved as the magnetic field is mostly confined to the volume between the LV and HV windings.

4) Dielectric Losses: Dielectric losses in transformers are often
low enough to be neglected in the design procedure. However, with increasing insulation requirements and operating frequencies, the losses in the dielectric material can reach considerable values

HV winding presents increased heat extraction challenges as typically isolation materials posses low thermal con- ductivities. In

!power density
The maximum achievable 
power density is 146kW/liter with an efficiency of 99.75% whereas the maximum reachable efficiency 99.79% with a power density of 78kW/liter.

The Vitrovac material features a lower saturation flux density and also higher specific losses and consequently lower efficiencies and power densities are achieved with this material.

TABLE-III loss comparison (literature review'a zaten eklenmis)

As can be seen, for similar power losses, the transformers with HV cable isolation present a volume ∼300% larger than the potted-isolated concepts. However, the advantage coming with this isolation solution is a much easier transformer construction, which avoids manufacturing custom made potted windings for the HV side.
