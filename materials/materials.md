## Nano-crystalline

Vacuumschmelze is one of the biggest magnetic material manufacturers. They have the following soft magnetic nano-crystalline materials available:

Nanocrystalline VITROPERM alloys are based on Fe with Si and B with Nb and Cu additives.

VITROPERM nano-crystalline alloys are optimized to combine highest permeability and lowest coercive field strength. The combination of very thin tapes and the relatively high electrical resistance (1.1 – 1.2 μΩm) ensure minimal eddy current losses and an outstanding frequency vs. permeability behaviour. Along with saturation flux density of 1.2 T and wide operational temperature range, these features combine to make VITROPERM a universal solution for most common EMC problems and vastly superior in many aspects to commonly used ferrite and amorphous materials.

The permeability of VITROPERM 500F is significantly higher than ferrite in the low frequency range.

The high Curie temperature of VITROPERM alloys
(above 600 °C), allows short term maximum operating temperatures as high as 180 – 200 °C).

For power transformers in switched-mode power supplies, the nano-crystalline material VITROPERM 500 F and the amorphous alloy VITROVAC 6030 F offer unique advantages:

* low losses with very small temperature dependence or even negative temperature coefficients.
* high saturation flux density which is almost completely retained at high temperatures. So the SMPS - designer can choose
* lower operating frequencies to cost down on power semiconductors and EMI - filtering.
* sufficiently high permeability and its low dependence of flux density and temperature.
* mechanical sturdiness of the coated cores and nearly no magneto-striction of the core material enables the design of moulded components. High vibration stresses are not critical for VITROPERM.

Usually nano-crystalline VITROPERM 500 F is the best choice due to the higher saturation flux density, the improved performance and lower cost compared to amorphous VITROVAC 6030 F. 

But, the higher permeability of VITROPERM transformers may be problematic for the reset behaviour in high-frequency single-ended forward converter topologies. We recommend to use VITRO-VAC 6030 F instead. In push-pull forward converters however, high permeabilities are advantageous in most cases.

It can be seen from the table that nano-crystalline and amorphous materials are the most suggested materials for medium frequency transformers that work between 1 kHz and 25 kHz.


Silicon-Steel: It is a popular choice in line frequency power transformers for its low cost and high-saturation magnetic induction. However, core losses of silicon-steel is high, which makes them unsuitable for medium frequency transformers.

Amorphous and Nanocrystalline: 
These materials have relatively high saturation point (1.2 - 1.56 T), and the reduced losses make them a suitable core material for applications in the 1-25 kHz range. Furthermore, the performance of these materials does not change significantly with temperature, thus it would be possible to choose a higher operating temperature \cite{Villar2010}. 

Ferrites:
Ferrites have a low-loss density in high-frequencies, which makes them a suitable material for high-frequency applications such as RF-filters and chokes. However, they have saturation flux density around 0.5 T, which increases the core volume in high power applications.
