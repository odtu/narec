\section{Introduction}


A literature review is presented by Robert Fox within WP 2 and different medium-frequency transformers were compared and transformer components are listed. This report will focus on the core materials and main losses in a transformer.


Increasing frequency of a transformer reduces its volume and cost. In \cite{Prasai2007}, it is stated that the weight and size of a 3 MW 1.2 kHz transformer is less than 8\% of an equivalent 50 Hz unit. In Fig.~\ref{transformer-vols}, volume variation with operating frequency for a 1 MW transformer is presented.

However, as the frequency is increased effects such as skin and proximity, hysteresis losses and dielectric losses are significantly increased in relation to operation at line frequency. the design of the transformer becomes more important for maximum efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in size usually implies increased power density, which which demands considerable thermal management efforts. 
Important design factors in line and medium to high frequency transformers are tabulated in Table~\ref{important}.
Challenges of medium-high frequency transformers can be listed as 
 \cite{Villar2010}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Loss reduction for higher frequency range.
\item Efficient thermal management, higher power levels are contained in equal
volumes.
\item High-dielectric stress generated by rapidly changing rectangular voltage waveforms.
\item High-isolation levels are required (due to multi-level inverter structure).
\item Generation of acoustic noise, which reaches the most sensitive range of the human ear.
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Materials}

Although, various types of electrical steel laminations are commonly used in power transformers. As the operating frequency is increased, there are more options available:

\subsection*{Amorphous Materials}

Amorphous cores are typically made of Metglas (metalic glass alloy), which is a thin non-crystalline amorphous metal alloy of iron, boron, silicon and phosphorus. The material has a much higher resistivity in electrical steel which results in a low eddy losses. Furthermore, the hysteresis losses are lower, thus, no-load losses in a transformer with amorphous core will be much lower compared to one with electrical steel. However, amorphous materials usually have lower saturation flux density compared to conventional iron-silicon electrical steel.

Some manufacturers of amorphous transformer cores can be listed as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Hitachi Metals (Powerlite)
  \item Vacuumschmelze (Vitrovac)
  \item Metglas
  \item Vijai Electricals
\end{itemize}

Amorphous materials are superior to electrical steel laminations. However, nano-crystalline materials are superior to amorphous materials, with their lower cost, higher flux densities \cite{vitroperm_vitrovac}. Nano-crystalline materials will be discussed in the next section. The specifications of amorphous and nano-crystalline materials are compared in Table~\ref{vitropermvitrovac}. The only  application that a amorphous material can be more advantageous is the  high-frequency single-ended forward converter topologies. For other topologies, the nano-crystalline materials are though to be more suitable.

\begin{table}[]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
 & Amorphous & Nano-crystalline \\ 
 & (Vitrovac) & (Vitroperm) \\
\hline
Saturation Flux Density & 0.8 T & 1.2 T \\
Losses (f= 20 kHz, B=0.2 T) & 2 W/kg & 1.4 W/kg \\
Max. Operating temperature & $110\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ & $120\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ \\
Curie temperature & $365\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ & $600\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
\caption{Comparison of amorphous (Vitrovac) and nano-crystalline (Vitroperm) materials \cite{vitroperm_vitrovac}.}
\label{vitropermvitrovac}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Nano-crystalline}

Nano-crystalline is a fairly new material that consists of approximately 80\% of iron with the remaining is mixture of silicon, boron, carbon, nickel and other materials. This is a special type of amorphous material, which has superior magnetic characteristics, such as lower core loss and high permeability. Other specifications can be listed as \cite{Magnetics}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Up to 50 \% permeability than 80\% nickel material (e.g. Supermalloy).
  \item High saturation flux density (1.2-1.5 T).
  \item High operating temperature up to $130\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.
  \item Minimal change of magnetic characteristics with temperature.
  \item 17 \% lighter than Nickel with a density of 7.3 $\mathrm{g/cm^3}$.
  \item Stacking density up to 90 \% can be achieved.
\end{itemize}


Some main manufacturers of nano-crystalline materials can be listed as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item MK Magnetics
  \item Vacuumschmelze
  \item Hill-Tech
\end{itemize}

In this section, different types of nano-crystalline materials will be compared. 
Vacuumschmelze manufactures the following soft magnetic nano-crystalline materials:


\subsubsection*{VitroPerm}


Nanocrystalline VITROPERM alloys are based on Fe with Si and B with Nb and Cu additives \cite{vitroterm_manual}. VITROPERM nano-crystalline alloys are optimized to combine highest permeability and lowest coercive field strength. The combination of very thin tapes and the relatively high electrical resistance (1.1-1.2~$\mu \Omega m$) to ensure minimal eddy current losses and an outstanding frequency vs. permeability behaviour. Along with saturation flux density of 1.2 T and wide operational temperature range, these features combine to make VITROPERM  superior in many aspects to commonly used ferrite and amorphous materials. Magnetization curves and B-H characteristics of Vitroperm material are presented in Fig.~\ref{vitroterm_BH}.

\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{vitroperm_magnetization}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{vitroterm_hysteresis}
    \caption{Magnetisation curve and B-H characteristics of Vitroperm \cite{vitroterm_manual}.}
  \label{vitroterm_BH}
\end{figure}

Vitroperm has a wide range material options with different permeability scale as as shown in Fig.~\ref{vitroterm_permeability}. 
The permeability of Vitroperm 500F is significantly higher than ferrite as shown in Fig.~\ref{vitroperm500_250_permeability}.

\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{vitroterm_permeability}
  \caption{Permeability change of different Vitroperm materials with frequency \cite{vitroterm_toroidal}.}
  \label{vitroterm_permeability}
\end{figure}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{vitroperm500_250_permeability}
  \caption{Permeability change of Vitroperm 250F($\mu = 5000$), Vitroperm 500F($\mu = 40000$) and ferrite($\mu = 5000$) with frequency. \cite{vitroterm_manual}.}
  \label{vitroperm500_250_permeability}
\end{figure}


Vitroperm has also a high operating temperature compared to ferrite. The Curie temperature of Vitroperm alloys are $600\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Furthermore, the saturation flux density only reduces by 10\% at $120\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, which allows the core can be overloaded for short-amount of periods up to $180-200 \,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The variation of permeability with temperature for Vitroperm is presented in Fig.~\ref{temp_vs_saturation}.

\end{figure}

%Density: 7.35 g/cm3
\subsection*{Silicon-Steel}

Silicon-steel is a popular choice in line frequency power transformers for its low cost and high-saturation magnetic induction. However, core losses of silicon-steel is high compared to other materials, which makes them unsuitable for medium frequency transformers. The core losses of material will be compared in the next section.

\subsection*{Ferrites}

Ferrites have a low-loss density in very high-frequencies, which makes them a suitable material for high-frequency applications such as RF-filters and chokes. However, they have saturation flux density around 0.5 T, which increases the core volume and mass in high power applications. 

\subsection*{Core Material Comparison}

Different core materials and manufacturers are presented in Table~\ref{core-loss-table}. In Fig.~\ref{material_table}, prototypes with common core materials are presented. It can be seen from the table that nano-crystalline and amorphous materials are the most suggested materials for medium frequency transformers that work between 1 kHz and 25 kHz.

  \label{material_table}
\end{figure}

The hysteresis losses and the core loss of different materials are compared in Fig.~\ref{core-loss}. Core losses in a logaritmic scale are presented in Fig.~\ref{core-loss-log}. It can bee seen that between 1 kHz and 1 kHz, the core loss of 0.3 mm silicon-steel laminations are 25 times higher than nano-crystalline material. 
A 50 kV, high frequency (20 kHz), 150 kW transformer that uses nano-crystalline is presented in \cite{Filchev2009}, in which the core losses are estimated as 60W/kg at an operating flux density of 1 T.

\section{Losses in a Transformer}

\subsection{AC Winding Losses}

The high frequency excitation in a medium frequency transformer has two main effects in the transformer windings:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Skin Effect: In AC excitation the current itself generates an opposing magnetic field and current, which reduce the net current density inside the conductor. The total current will stay same, but the distribution will be higher across the circumference of the conductor.
  \item Proximity Effect is the interaction between two adjacent conductors that alters the current distribution in the conductor. Same principles(e.g. proximity, frequency) apply in the proximity affect.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Skin Effect}

Skin effect is an important factor in AC resistance and eddy current losses in a transformer. Skin effect is effected by the skin depth, which can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{2\rho}{\mu \omega}}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the conductor, $\mu$ is permeability, and $\omega$ is the frequency in rad/s. Skin depth of copper for different operating frequencies are presented in Table~\ref{skin-depth}. For reasonable AC resistance characteristics, the rule of thumb is to choose the conductor diameter smaller than 1.6 times of the skin depth. Thus, for a 1-2 kHz transformer application, the conductor shouldn't be thicker than 2-3 mm. 

\begin{table}[]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Frequency & Skin Depth \\
\hline
50 Hz & 9.2 mm \\
1 kHz & 2.06 mm \\
2 kHz & 1.49 mm \\
5 kHz & 0.94 mm \\
10 kHz & 0.65 mm \\
50 kHz & 0.29 mm \\
\hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
\caption{Skin depth in a copper conductor.}
\label{skin-depth}
\end{table}

In a step-up transformer the cross-section area of the primary conductor will be larger. However, the limit due to skin-depth limits the thickness of the conductor. Therefore, the most feasible way is to use foil conductors in the primary windings. 
Dowell calculated eddy losses in foil type transformer windings in \cite{Dowell1966}. A detailed explanation of these one dimensional Maxwell equations can be found in \cite{Villar2010} and a summary will be presented in this section.

The DC resistance of a foil winding can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  R_{dc} = \rho \frac{L_{mean}}{t_w h_w} N_{turns}
\end{equation}

where $L_{mean}$ is the mean turn length of the coil, $t_w$ is the thickness, $h_w$ is the height, $\rho$ is the resistivity of copper.

The AC resistance is more complicated to calculate and depends on the ratio of the wire thickness to skin depth ($\delta$) and can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  R_{ac}=\rho \frac{L_{mean}}{h_w \delta} N_{turns} \left[\varsigma_1 + \frac{2}{3} (N_{turns}^2-1)\varsigma_2\right]
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
  \varsigma_1 = \dfrac{sinh(2\Delta)+sin(2\Delta)}{cosh(2\Delta)-cos(2\Delta)} \quad
  \varsigma_2 = \dfrac{sinh(\Delta)-sin(\Delta)}{cosh(\Delta)+cos(\Delta)} \quad  
  \Delta = \dfrac{t_w}{\delta}
\end{equation}

as can be seen from the equation above,  the important factor is the penetration factor (i.e the ratio of conductor thickness to skin depth, $\Delta$). The ratio of AC resistance to DC resistance is called Dowell's resistance factor ($F_r$). The resistance factor as a function of penetration ratio for a 2 mm thick foil wire is presented in Fig.~\ref{resistance_factor}. For example, at 1 kHz the skin depth is 2.1 mm (the penetration ratio is approximately 1), the resistance factor is 2.7 for a layer number of 4. Thus the resistive losses will be 2.7 times more compared to DC conduction.
